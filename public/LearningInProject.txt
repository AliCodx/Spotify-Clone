// I understand the importance of response.json() and response.text()
-> use response.json() [this parses the response as Json and converted it into Js array or object]
* to convert json file into the Js code which exist in Json file if Json file contain object, this convert the Json file object into real Js object and if Js code contain array like, the this converted the Json into real Js array.
-> use response.text() [this parses the response as Json and converted it into text format]
* Usefull when we are fetching the local folder using fetch() .



let songsurl = new URL("http://127.0.0.1:3000/songs/");
-> open the index.html of project using vs code on google chrome. Then go in the url tab of google and change the address from 
http://127.0.0.1:3000/index.html/ to http://127.0.0.1:3001/songs/ to open the song folder.

-> issue with above code . when we host the project then js not find 127.0.0 ... address because its the liver server local address.
-> so use another approah . make the json file which contain address of all the songs. & many more explained in the code.

// scroll -> scrollLeft → how much you’ve moved from the left (like your walking distance).
// clientWidth → the window through which you see the content. (the width of the container).
// scrollWidth → the total length of the whole scrollable area.
// how to check that "Is the rightmost visible edge touching the end of the content ? "
// logic -> right edge = scrollLeft + clientWidth
